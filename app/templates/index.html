      <h2> Who I Am</h2>
 <p>My name is Dan Silver and I am currently pursuing
        a dual Bachelor's and Master's degree in Computer Engineering,
        concentrating in Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and Algorithms.
        I am in my 4th year of study at Northeastern University.
       Throughout my time in college, I have accumulated 21 months of on the job internship experience
        over the course of 4 sucessful internships.
       My graduate GPA is a 4.0
        and my Major GPA is  3.66. While my degree
        is more hardware based, my work experience and personal projects are
       more based on a mix of machine learning, computer vision, and software.
       Right now I am looking for a data science software engineering job once I graduate in June 2020!
